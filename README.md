# 1xtodo
#### _ToDo List project as I could not find one that works like I want it to work._

This project is just started and does not do much atm. 
## Features

- ✨Little to no documentation! x3
- ✨Can Write to a txt file. (If you dont want the hassle with seting up a MySQL database... Use the version in the folder: "txt-based" that comes with incredibly limmited options! AMAZING! )
- ✨Uses MySQL if you are serious, not Sirius!
- ✨Missing option to delete or complete tasks :D
- ✨Has other options!

# Installlation instuctions...
- DB queries:
`CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  task VARCHAR(2048) NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('incomplete', 'completed') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'incomplete'
);` 
`CREATE TABLE log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id INT NOT NULL,
  event VARCHAR(2048) NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);`
